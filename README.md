# NetRouter

This application runs as a Windows Service and allows you to redirect TCP/IP traffic to a host or IP address of your choosing. Unlike some dedicated hardware devices, you’ll find that load-balancing and/or fail-over configurations are easy to setup – but you’ll also find some of the more advanced options such as session persistence, buffering, HTTP header manipulation and even built in tracing for simple troubleshooting.

As always, the service is high performance, secure, and can be remotely administered through an easy to use management interface.
